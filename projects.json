In gripping the device base, turning the crank, and hearing the clunky gears churn, the user’s attention is directed back to their own body while using a tool that typically has a dissociating, disembodying effect.",

By providing a toolkit of simple behaviors, the game allows for users to create complex and unexpected simulations, providing the opportunity to not only act as a player, but also a game maker and storyteller.",
